# React Expense Tracker

The React Expense Tracker is a simple web application that allows you to keep track of your expenses. This project was developed as part of the ["React - The Complete Guide (incl. Redux)"](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) course on Udemy. The project presented here is an implementation of the concepts covered in the course, and serves as a demonstration of the skills I have learned through the course. The code in this project is my own work, but is based on the exercises and examples presented in the course. I also changed the UI that i prototyped in Figma. You can enter expenses by providing a title, date, and amount. Once entered, you can filter your expenses by year to get a better understanding of your spending habits.

## Features

The React Expense Tracker includes the following features:

-   **Expense entry:** Easily enter expenses with a title, date, and value.
-   **Expense filtering:** Filter expenses by year to view your spending habits.
-   **Dynamic updates:** Automatically update your expense list when new expenses are added or when you apply a filter.
